## 🎯 Game Rules

### Basic Rules
1. Each player starts with cards numbered 1-7
2. Players simultaneously select one card per round
3. Higher card wins the round and scores 1 point

5. Player with most points after 7 rounds wins

### Advanced Rules

## 📱 Usage Guide

### Single Player Mode
1. Tap "Single Player" on main menu
2. Choose difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
3. Select cards strategically considering:
   - Current score difference
   - Remaining cards in hand
   - Potential card locks
   - Special 5th round opportunities

### Multiplayer Modes
1. **Online Match**: Tap "Online Match" for random opponent matching
2. **Friend Match**: 
   - Create room and share 6-digit code with friend
   - Or enter friend's room code to join

### Strategy Tips
- **Early Game**: Use low cards (1-3) to preserve high cards
- **Mid Game**: Consider opponent's remaining cards
- **Late Game**: Calculate exact winning scenarios
- **5th Round**: Look for consecutive card opportunities
- **Card Locking**: Plan 2-3 moves ahead to avoid self-locks
